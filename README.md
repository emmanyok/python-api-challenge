Weather Patterns
•	One of the trends seen in this dataset for the cities is that most of it was divided in two hemispheres(North and South). 

•	 In the northern hemisphere, the max temperature decreases while the city is away from 0 degree latitude and humidity increases while the city is away from 0 degree latitude.
•	 While in the southern hemisphere, the max temperature increases while the city is close to 0 degree latitude and humidity slightly increases with the city close to 0 degree latitude.          
•	Another observation shows that the max temperature increases as the latitude of the cities approaching the interval of -20 to 20. The higher the latitude, the lower the temperature. Most of the cities tend to have a humidity above 60%, while the humidity of those cities with latitude between 0 to 40 tends to vary more. Cities with latitude between 40 to 80 often have a humidity between 80% to 100%. However, the rest of the data points seem to distributed evenly on the plot. Hence, there isn't much of a correlation between coludiness and latitude with  wind speed of 0MPH to 8MPH, with some cities at a higher(positive and negative) latitude having higher wind speed.

•	Lastly, a trend in the VacationPy shows high humidity volumes as shown in the heatmap representing maximum or near-maximum humidity for the areas shown. The values are higher in cities close to the major water bodies compared to inland cities.
